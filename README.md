# Tools

* [Remix Ethereum](http://remix.ethereum.org/)
* MetaMask

## General information 

Each Smart Contract can be executed via Remix (or Ganache). 
In this instance I deployed the Smart Contract via Remix with a real time visualization through MetaMask upon execution of the contract. 
To replicate this contract, I've used the Ropsten Test Network. In case you need any Ethereum in your test wallet, you can do so through [Faucet Ropsten](https://faucet.ropsten.be/).
